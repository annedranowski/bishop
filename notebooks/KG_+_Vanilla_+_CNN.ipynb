        "Suppose we have $N(m)$ knots with $m$ crossings, and $k$ available transformations. We want to know how many transformations we need to apply to get roughly the same amount of output knots. Let $n(m)$ be the number of transformed pictures for knot with $m$ crossings. The first and the naivest one can do to equitably distribute transforms is to abide by simple proportion: $n(m) \\cdot N(m) = n(j) \\cdot N(j) \\implies n(m) = n(j) \\frac{N(j)}{N(m)}$. Since the smallest possible value of $N$ is $1$ (obtainable at $m = 0, 3, 4$) and the maximum value of $n$ is $2^{k}$ we therefore can assume $n(0, 3, 4) = 2^{k}$. So, for each crossing number (and as we want every knot to be in the data) $i: n(m) = \\max(1, round(\\frac{2^{k}}{N(m)}))$ (given $j = 0$), where $round(x) = x, \\{x\\} < 0.5, [x]+1 \\ \\text{otherwise}$ where $\\{x\\}$ and $[x]$ are fractional and integer parts respectively.\n",

        "Let $f_{i}$ be the number of $i$-th transform needed to be applied. We want to get uniformly distributed transformations, so ideal case is $f_i = f_j$. Let's use bit string $s$ where $i$-th bit represens whether the $i$-th transormation is applied or not. Thus, $f_i$ shows how many times we set $i$-th bit. So we cannot have diferent $f$'s since each $s$ requires us to define every bit so the values of $f$'s must be the same. Therefore, $f_i = n$.\n",
        "\n",
        "We want our $i$-th transform to be completely random, so $ p(s[i] = 0) = \\frac{1}{2}$. Then we set $s[i] = 0$ in $\\lceil \\frac{f_i}{2} \\rceil$ cases and $s[i] = 1$ in $\\lfloor \\frac{f_i}{2} \\rfloor$ (we are also able to do it vise versa, but it doesn't give any impact and increase average runtime since it is biased to apply transformation).\n",
        "Suppose that at the $l$-th step we have $a$ cases $s[i] = 0$ left and $b$ respectively. Hence, we do not apply $i$-th transform and update $a = a - 1$ with probability $p(s[i] = 0) = \\frac{a}{a+b}$ and apply and update $b = b - 1$ with $p(s[i] = 1) = \\frac{b}{a+b}$.\n",
